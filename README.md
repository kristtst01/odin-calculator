# odin-calculator

The calculator works as expected, no styling so looks bad but oh well. 
No keyboard support yet. Could probably just alter the eventlisteners to also accept keystrokes and then regex the display (like . is done) to not allow for anything but numbers.
Miiight do it later, but kinda bored with the project rn.
